# Billiards
###### University project - 3D billiards game based on C++ and OpenGL
## Description
3D billiards game created for a Computer Graphics project on university. Game doesn't include billiards rules, it's just graphics and physics simulation. Player can control camera and cue using mouse and keyboard, which is described thoroughly in built-in main menu's help. Physics in the game isn't based on general physics laws, it's just arbitrary approximation. The player is able to change power of cue strike and ball friction in-game.
